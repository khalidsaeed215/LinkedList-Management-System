# Linked List Management System

## Overview

This C++ program manages a linked list allowing for adding, deleting, searching, and sorting of nodes. Each node represents an individual with a name and a score. The program supports sorting the list in ascending and descending order based on scores and offers a file input system for bulk operations.

## Features

- **Add Nodes**: Insert new individuals into the list in a sorted manner.
- **Delete Nodes**: Remove individuals from the list by name.
- **Search**: Find and display information about individuals in the list by name.
- **Sort**: Rearrange the list in either ascending or descending order based on scores.
- **File Input**: Perform bulk operations (Add, Delete, Search, Sort) using commands from a file.

## File Format for Bulk Operations (`a3.txt`)

The program reads a specially formatted file to perform bulk operations. The file can contain commands such as `%INSERT`, `%DELETE`, `%SEARCH`, `%SORTASC`, `%SORTDES`, and `%END` to control the flow of operations.
